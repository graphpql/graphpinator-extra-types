:zap::globe_with_meridians::zap: Some useful and commonly used types, both scalar or composite.

## Introduction

This package includes some commonly used types. Those types are not covered by the specs and therefore are not part of the main Graphpinator package.

## Installation

Install package using composer

```composer require infinityloop-dev/graphpinator-extra-types```

## How to use

In order to enable the types on your server, the only thing you need to do is to put selected types to your `Container`. You may use all or only some.

> Some of the types have special requirements on `infinityloop-dev/graphpinator-constraint-directives`, which needs to be enabled first if you wish to use according type.

This package contains the following types:
